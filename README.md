# my-learnyounode
This repo contains all my answers to the Javascript programming game/quiz of "LearnYouNode".

* If you haven't done it, go and checkout http://nodeschool.io/
* If you want to start playing just install **node** and **npm**  and in your terminal type: 
```BASH
    npm install -g learnyounode
```

This game is really good to understand callbacks, servers, APIs and basic functions in node.
